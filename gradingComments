Question 1: Algorithms. 10/10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10
You're incrementing depth_count after each dequeue, which is going to yield
an incorrect count. Better to store this as a member variable for each node,
and then make depth = parent.depth + 1

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10
